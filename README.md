The analysis of bike purchase data across regions, home ownership status, and marital status reveals several interesting trends. Out of 1000 individuals surveyed, 481 (48.1%) purchased bikes, while 519 (51.9%) did not. Regionally, the Pacific shows the highest percentage of bike purchases (58.9%), followed by Europe (49.3%), and North America with the lowest at 43.3%. When considering home ownership, homeowners in Europe and North America are more inclined to purchase bikes compared to non-homeowners, while in the Pacific, non-homeowners exhibit a higher purchase rate (63.4%) than homeowners.

Marital status also plays a significant role in bike purchasing behavior. In Europe, the purchase rates are almost evenly split between married and single individuals, both around 50%. In North America, single individuals have a higher likelihood of purchasing bikes (53.6%) compared to married individuals (36%). Similarly, in the Pacific, single individuals are more likely to purchase bikes (63.9%) than married individuals (53.7%).

These findings suggest that marketing strategies for bike sales should consider regional preferences, home ownership status, and marital status to better target potential customers. The Pacific region, particularly among non-homeowners and single individuals, presents a strong market for bike purchases. In contrast, efforts in North America might focus more on single individuals who show a higher propensity to buy bikes. Understanding these demographic nuances can aid in developing more effective marketing campaigns and addressing the specific needs and preferences of different customer segments.
